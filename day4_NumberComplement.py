'''
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.



Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.


Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.


Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/


hint:
print(bin(5))==0b101
so we need to replace '0b' with an empty string.

Solution:



class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        a = bin(num).replace("0b", "")
        x = ''.join([str((int(c) ^ 1)) for c in a])
        return int(x, 2)
